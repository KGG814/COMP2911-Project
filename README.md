COMP2911-Project
================

Separated the solver, gui and board.
Please add stuff and/or tag your name when you're doing something.

TODO:

<<<<<<< HEAD
Make GUI 9x9 cells instead of 3x3. Or if we want to do 3x3, abstract it up a level so that the solving algorithms can still operate on the board at a 9x9 level.

8/5/2013 

Daniel: Fix Up GUI and relate GUI to our initial representation of the board (i.e solved array list with GUI)

Kalana: Get SudokuSolutions and SudokuGenerator Working

Chad: Start Main GUI Layout, without implementation so set Buttons with Labels but no actions. Design some pictures for GUI
=======
Have GUI display the values in its cell array

Implement sudoku generator - Kalana

Class diagrams

Menu system

Highscore system

Think of new ideas for GUI
>>>>>>> Added a SudokuSolver Class
