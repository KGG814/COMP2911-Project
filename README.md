TODO List:

SudokuBoard is quite bloated now, should split solution from the main board function.

Make GUI 9x9 cells instead of 3x3. Or if we want to do 3x3, abstract it up a level so that the solving algorithms can still operate on the board at a 9x9 level.

8/5/2013 

Daniel: Fix Up GUI and relate GUI to our initial representation of the board (i.e solved array list with GUI)
Kalana: Get SudokuSolutions and SudokuGenerator Working
Chad: Start Main GUI Layout, without implementation so set Buttons with Labels but no actions.
